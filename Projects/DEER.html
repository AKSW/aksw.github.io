    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>Over the last years, the Linked Data principles have been used across academia and industry to publish and consume structured data. Thanks to the fourth Linked Data principle, many of the RDF datasets used within these applications contain implicit and explicit references to more data. For example, music datasets such as Jamendo include references to locations of record labels, places where artists were born or have been, etc. Datasets such as Drugbank contain references to drugs from DBpedia, were verbal description of the drugs and their usage is explicitly available. The goal of mapping component, dubbed DEER, is to retrieve this information, make it explicit and integrate it into data sources according to the specifications of the user. To this end, DEER relies on a simple yet powerful pipeline system that consists of two main components: enrichment functions and operators.</dd>
