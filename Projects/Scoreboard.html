    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>Evidence-based policy is policy informed by rigorously established objective evidence.
An important aspect of evidence-based policy is the use of scientifically rigorous studies to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy relevant outcomes. 
Statistics represent a crucial means to determine whether progress is made towards policy targets.
In May 2010, the European Commission adopted the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), a strategy to take advantage of the potential offered by the rapid progress of digital technologies.
The DAE is part of the overall Europe2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
In order to chart the progress of both the announced policy actions and the key performance targets a scoreboard is published, thus allowing the monitoring and benchmarking of the main developments of information society in European countries.Â </dd>
