    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>The original intention behind SAIM (pronounced like “same”) was to provide an interface desgined to support instance matching on RDF data. Its main apllication was then intended to support the discovery of links between knowledge bases across the Linked Data Web with semi-automic approaches. In addition to providing achieving this goal by provinding interfaces that allow users either manually or semi-automatically generating class matchings, property matchings and link specifications, SAIM has been paired with LIMES and now provides an extended range of functionality. For example, it now includes interfaces the fully unsupervised learning of link specifications. In addition, LIMES' machine learning algorithms such as RAVEN (RApid actiVE liNking) and EAGLE (Efficient Active Learning of Link Specifications Using Genetic Programming) can be utilized in SAIM.</dd>
