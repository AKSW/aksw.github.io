    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>Knowledge bases published on the Web of Data can be used to answer challenging questions about a wide range of topics. They usually offer a SPARQL endpoint, which can be queried by the user. However, a novice user needs to acquire both knowledge about the underlying ontology and proficiency in formulating SPARQL queries in order to actually formulate a SPARQL query. In this project, we are working on constructing SPARQL queries based on user-supplied keywords. As a result ordinary users are empowered to formulate relatively expressive queries without knowledge of SPARQL and the underlying ontology structure.</dd>
