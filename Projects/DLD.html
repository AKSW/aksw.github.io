    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>Popular knowledge bases that provide SPARQL endpoints for the web are usually experiencing a high number of requests, which often results in low availability of their interfaces. A common approach to counter the availability issue is to run a local mirror of the knowledge base. Running a SPARQL endpoint is currently a complex task which requires a lot of effort and technical support for domain experts who just want to use the SPARQL interface.

With our approach of containerised knowledge base shipping we are introducing a simple to setup methodology for running a local mirror of an RDF knowledge base and SPARQL endpoint with interchangeable exploration components. The flexibility of the presented approach further helps maintaining the publication infrastructure for dataset projects.
