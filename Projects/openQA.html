    <dt>Abstract:</dt>
    <dd>The use of Semantic Web technologies led to an increasing number of structured data published on the Web.
Despite the advances on question answering systems retrieving the desired information from structured sources is still a substantial challenge.
Users and researchers still face difficulties to integrate and compare their results.
openQA is an open source question answering framework that unifies approaches from several domain experts.
The aim of openQA is to provide a common platform that can be used to promote advances by easy integration and measuring different approaches.</dd>
