  <p>GET, founded in 2006, is located in Athens, Greece and is an SME specialized in marketing and supply of geospatial products and software services in the field of GeoInformatics in Greece, Europe and Africa. GET has successfully delivered a large number of projects for the public and private sector in Greece and abroad, with significant experience across the entire lifecycle of geospatial data production, and land cover/use data in particular. GET produces, maintains and curates geospatial data for the public and private sector, which are used from thousands of companies on a national level. One of GETâ€™s greatest business drivers is the provision of accurate and timely geospatial information (POIs) to power local and national services for the tourism industry. This is a current priority for national economy and development, and demands low-cost and highly accurate data covering a diverse range of general (e.g. hotels, cultural, food) and specialized tourism domains (e.g. agri-, eco-, religious-, cruise/boat, wedding -tourism), as well as multi-lingual content for emerging non-EU countries (e.g. China, Russia). In addition, GET develops and implements Spatial Data Infrastructures and open geospatial data infrastructures, providing technical support, training, and consulting services for open source GIS solutions. Solutions provided by GET are based on well-known FOSS4G, as well as on in-house development products (like GET SDI Portal), and are conformant with EU (INSPIRE Directive) and international standards (e.g. OGC, W3C). GET is member of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), the Open Data Institute (ODI), the si-Cluster of the Corallia Initiative, and the Hellenic Association of Space Industry. GET has an installed customer base in various countries, Cyprus, Ecuador, Ghana, Greece, United Kingdom, focusing in EMEA, covering a wide range of
industries.</p>
