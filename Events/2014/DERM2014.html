  <h2 class="title is-1">Workshop on Data Management and Electronic Resource Management in Libraries (DERM 2014)</h2>
  <p>The objectives of the international workshop DERM 2014, as part of the <a href="http://www.informatik2014.de">INFORMATIK 2014</a> conference in Stuttgart (Germany) is concerned with the transition of traditional information systems to a web-oriented and Linked Data oriented infrastructure in libraries. The initial focus within this research field is on evaluating the complexity of existing databases and accordingly providing correct data alignments. As a consequence thereof, another focus is on the development as well as the deployment of adaptive information systems. These systems can be used flexibly in new business processes within libraries, that are driven by tasks like managing and sharing heterogeneous data sets. Additionally, accumulating and augmenting data is made easier by providing tools that abstract from the technical details and the complexity of the Linked Data world as far as possible.</p>

<p>Within this context, the workshop addresses data engineers, knowledge engineers and software engineers, as well as users in the IT administration of libraries, information suppliers and other interested users. The conference languages are German and English.</p>

<h1 id="dates-and-details-regarding-the-submission-of-papers">Dates and details regarding the submission of papers</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Paper submission Deadline: <strong>May 12, 2014</strong></li>
  <li>Notification of Acceptance:  <strong>May 26, 2014</strong></li>
  <li>Camera Ready Version:  <strong>June 30, 2014</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We call for submission of papers on current research work and application of interesting use cases within the following research areas and application fields:</p>

<p>Data Management, Electronic Resource Management, Semantic Web, Linked Open Data, Linked Enterprise Data, Knowledge Engineering, Software Engineering, Service Engineering, Data Modelling, Process Modelling, Vocabulary Alignment, Instance Matching, Open Access, etc.</p>

<p>The submissions should be between 10â€“12 pages and in accordance with the INFORMATIK 2014 <a href="http://www.gi.de/service/publikationen/lni/">GI-Edition Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI)</a> formatting guidelines.
In addition, the workshop will provide the opportunity to present project ideas and implementations in the form of posters.</p>

<p>#Organisation</p>

<p>The program committee consists of domain experts from the library sector as well as of computer scientists from the research fields of Linked Open Data, Semantic Web, Information Systems, Data Management and Software Engineering.
The workshop will be organised by the Saxon State and University Library Dresden (Jens Mittelbach), the Leipzig University Library (Leander Seige), Avantgarde Labs Dresden (Torsten Hartmann), the Leipzig University of Applied Sciences - HTWK (Thomas Riechert) and the Institute for Applied Informatics Leipzig (Natanael Arndt, Andreas Nareike). Submissions and reviews of the contributions are made using the conference tool Easy Chair.</p>
